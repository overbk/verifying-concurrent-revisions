# verifying-concurrent-revisions
An Isabelle/HOL verification of the concurrent revisions concurrency control model. My master's thesis. For the actual formalization, see the publication at the [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Concurrent_Revisions.html).

In 2020, I [published](https://doi.org/10.1145/3372885.3373820) the research at the Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) conference ([publicly accessible preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09741)).
